# Individual_Tree_Height
## This code is used to segment individual tree and extract its height

This study constructed a joint computing framework for individual trees by integrating convolutional neural networks and the state-of-the-art Large Model for the first time. It can delineate individual tree crowns and heights from sub-meter resolution optical satellite.
